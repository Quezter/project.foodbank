        <h3>WHO WE ARE</h3>
        <p>
          We are a student organization operating out of the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. Originally we consisted of 9 members from the Transport and Supply Chain Management masters program, alongside the commander in chief - Professor Sander de Leeuw. We were first tasked with aiding and improving the logistics processes of the fresh food brigade, an Amsterdam Food Bank initiative. This initiative tries to reduce the amount of processed foods distributed to families and bring more fresh food to those who need it most.
        </p>
        <p>
          Started in September 2017, the project has developed into a promising endeavor, which hopes to add future value to the Amsterdam Food Bank. A number of projects are in the pipeline and recruitment is in place to build a sustainable team to provide long-term capacity, continuous support, and improvements, through student knowledge capabilities, to the Amsterdam Food Banks' operations.
        </p>
        
        <h3>WHAT WE DO</h3>
        <h1><em>We provide the support where no support is given.</em></h1>
        <p>
          The Amsterdam Food Bank is a non-profit organization that relies solely on donations to feed 20 000 people across the city of Amsterdam and North-Holland. With a lack of financial and fresh produce support, the FoodBank Project aims to provide support in these areas through creating and providing long-term sustainable solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond volunteer recruitment based support, the FoodBank Project uses student resources, pooled knowledge from different student backgrounds, to assess and measure key performance areas in order to identify and rectify potential improvement areas within the Amsterdam Food Bank.
